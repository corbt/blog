    markdown:
      I'm a recent college graduate from BYU. Although I'm originally from Seattle, my wife is currently studying at Queen Mary University of London, so we're located in the UK until further notice.

      In May of 2014 my friend [Sam](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=121107913) and I started a new company, [Emberall](http://emberall.com) (you'll notice, not coincidentally, a substantial narrowing of focus of my blog posts after that date). We're currently developing mobile video recording technology for weddings, funerals, corporate events, and other applications. You can see what we're up to at [emberall.com](https://emberall.com).

      I can be contacted at kyle@ this domain.
