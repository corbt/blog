  h1 About Me
  markdown:
    My mission is to use technology to do things that have never been done before.  I think that automation is a *good thing* that will allow us to solve tough problems and achieve exciting goals communally.  The near-magical ability of computers to solve problems that humans don't have time for has fascinated me for my entire life, and controlling that is a ton of fun.

    I'm currently a university student and am interested in machine learning.  I also have a fair amount of experience with web development, including Rails and AngularJS.  I'm all about learning and using new technology to solve tough problems.

    I can be contacted at kyle@ this domain.
