    markdown:
      I'm a software engineer with a CS degree and well-rounded experience. Although I'm originally from Seattle, my wife is currently studying at Queen Mary University of London, so we're located in the UK until further notice.

      In May of 2014 my friend [Sam](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=121107913) and I started a new company, Emberall. We're currently developing easy-to-use mobile video recording technology for video interviews, with a focus on capturing the life stories of senior citizens. You can see what we're up to at [emberall.com](https://emberall.com).

      I can be contacted at kyle@ this domain.
