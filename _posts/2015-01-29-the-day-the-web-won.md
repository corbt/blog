## This Just In: React.js coming to native mobile

Yesterday, Facebook's [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) team shook up the mobile development world by announcing that the framework would soon be able to power native applications on iOS and Android. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Just announced: react native. Use react and JS to build native apps (native views, not DOM) and interpret gestures. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/reactjsconf?src=hash">#reactjsconf</a></p>&mdash; Pete Hunt (@floydophone) <a href="https://twitter.com/floydophone/status/560503411389390848">January 28, 2015</a></blockquote>

As a long-time React fan who has reluctantly been forced to do some native Android development recently for performance reasons, this looks like a big win. But what interested me most about the announcement was how it plays into a broader trend.

React takes a lot of ideas from the reactive/functional programming paradigm and applies them to UI in a unique way. An in-depth analysis of what makes React particularly exciting is beyond the scope of this blog, but I highly recommend the talk [React: Rethinking Best Practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7cQ3mrcKaY) that highlights some of its core philosophy surrounding reasoning about state with immutability and one-way data flow.

## The Bigger Picture

The web has never hit feature parity with what's possible in a native environment. Even today, we're barely getting support for decent camera access and useable background threads, to name two examples. But despite those limitations -- or perhaps because of them -- the innovation in front-end web development over the last decade has been simply explosive.

Something is different about app development on the web. Maybe it's the inherent limitations, that caused people to get creative. Maybe it's the youth of the medium. It might be the lack of an overarching "owner" of the platform, an Apple or Microsoft to say "Apps Shall Be Designed This Way." Perhaps it's because of the culture of sharing and collaboration growing up around Github. It might simply be the result of the overwhelming number of developers working in the ecosystem. But for some reason, somewhere along the way, creativity in web app development absolutely eclipsed anything going on with any other platform.

Whether you agree about React's strengths or not, the fact that it's now, after a couple of years of growing and maturing on the web, being ported to native clients is fascinating to me. 

When the original iPhone came out, developers weren't even allowed to create 3rd-party apps for it. The best you could do was bookmark a website to the home screen
